# First, lets make it like screen (eugh). Kinda dirty, but the ctrl-b binding is just dumb.
# It is too much of a contortion for something that is used that often
set -g prefix C-a
bind-key a send-prefix

# Vim-like visual copy paste
#unbind [
#bind Escape copy-mode
#unbind p
#bind p paste-buffer
#bind-key -t vi-copy 'v' begin-selection
#bind-key -t vi-copy 'y' copy-selection


# This first part makes the two commands for splitting the window:
# ctrl-b | = split side by side
# ctrl-b - = split up and down
unbind %
bind | split-window -h
bind - split-window -v

# C-a C-a for last window, from screen
bind-key C-a last-window

# use the vim motion keys to move between panes
bind h select-pane -L
bind j select-pane -D
bind k select-pane -U
bind l select-pane -R

# more screen compat
unbind " "
bind " " next-window
unbind A
bind A command-prompt "rename-window %%"

# swapping panes and windows also handled, but they form lists rather than real
# grids so vim keys not as great.
bind -r   J swap-pane -D
bind -r   K swap-pane -U
bind -r C-j swap-window -t -
bind -r C-k swap-window -t +

# copy buffer to clipboard with y, may put this on another key but this will do
# for now.

# use vim motion keys while in copy mode

# Start from 1, since I will be using the numbers at the top of the keyboard
#set -g base-index 1

# Show window activity
# Monitoring all activity is a bit much for things like irssi.
# Just want to monitor for bell, which can be controlled.
